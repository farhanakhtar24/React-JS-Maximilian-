/*
React can use React fragments , custom wrappers or Refs and they basically just render {props.children} in the DOM
and this helps us to remove the use of divs as wrappers on our content while writing the individual components

If we use the divs as wrappers approach then they can lead to unnecessary creation of a lot of divs
